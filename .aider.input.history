+Technical Specification (TS) – Recipe & Meal Planner App
+1. Project Overview
+
+The Recipe & Meal Planner app is a tool designed to help users store recipes, plan weekly meals, automatically generate shopping lists, and search for recipes by ingredients or categories.
+The application aims to simplify meal planning, reduce food waste, and make grocery shopping more efficient.
+
+2. Functional Requirements
+2.1 Recipe Management
+
+Users can add, edit, and delete recipes.
+
+Each recipe contains:
+
+Title
+
+Ingredients (with quantity and unit)
+
+Steps / Instructions
+
+Preparation and cooking time
+
+Category (e.g., Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Dessert)
+
+Optional image of the dish
+
+Tags (e.g., Vegetarian, Gluten-Free, Quick)
+
+Users can mark recipes as favorites for easy access.
+
+2.2 Weekly Meal Planner
+
+Users can plan meals for each day of the week.
+
+Each meal slot can be assigned a recipe.
+
+Users can copy a week’s plan to another week.
+
+Ability to view planned meals in calendar view or list view.
+
+Notifications/reminders for planned meals (optional).
+
+2.3 Automatic Shopping List
+
+Generate a shopping list based on planned recipes.
+
+Merge duplicate ingredients (e.g., 2x “tomatoes” → 4 tomatoes).
+
+Allow users to:
+
+Check/uncheck items while shopping
+
+Manually add items not in recipes
+
+Export list to text, CSV, or PDF
+
+Optional: categorize shopping list by sections (e.g., Vegetables, Dairy, Meat).
+
+2.4 Recipe Search & Filtering
+
+Search recipes by:
+
+Name or keyword
+
+Ingredient(s)
+
+Category
+
+Tags (e.g., Vegan, Quick)
+
+Search results display recipe title, category, and preparation time.
+
+Filter recipes based on dietary preferences or available ingredients.
+
+2.5 User Interface Requirements
+
+Clean, intuitive UI for easy navigation.
+
+Recipe creation/editing form.
+
+Weekly planner calendar view.
+
+Shopping list view with checkboxes and grouped categories.
+
+Search bar with filters.
+
+Optional: Light/Dark mode, adjustable font size.
+
+3. Non-Functional Requirements
+3.1 Platform
+
+Mobile app (iOS & Android recommended)
+
+Optionally web-based version.
+
+3.2 Performance
+
+Loading recipe list and weekly plan must be <0.5s.
+
+Searching recipes should be instantaneous (<1s for 1,000+ recipes).
+
+3.3 Data Storage
+
+Local storage (SQLite / Realm / IndexedDB for web) for offline access.
+
+Optional cloud sync for multi-device use.
+
+3.4 Security
+
+User data stored securely.
+
+Cloud sync (if implemented) should use encryption in transit and at rest.
+
+3.5 Usability
+
+Easy-to-use interface with minimal clicks for adding recipes or planning meals.
+
+Drag-and-drop for arranging meals in the planner (optional).
+
+Undo/redo support for edits.
+
+4. Recommended Technical Stack
+Option A – Mobile App
+
+Framework: Flutter or React Native
+
+Local database: SQLite or Realm
+
+Notifications: native push/local notifications
+
+Option B – Web App
+
+Frontend: React / Vue.js
+
+Backend: Node.js / Django
+
+Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB
+
+Optional: PWA for offline access
+
+5. Optional Future Enhancements
+
+User accounts & cloud sync across devices
+
+Recipe rating system
+
+AI-powered recipe suggestions based on past meals
+
+Nutritional information calculation
+
+Barcode scanner for ingredients
+
+Export meal plan & shopping list to calendar apps
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
