Technical Specification (TS) – Recipe & Meal Planner App
1. Project Overview

The Recipe & Meal Planner app is a tool designed to help users store recipes, plan weekly meals, automatically generate shopping lists, and search for recipes by ingredients or categories.

Optional image of the dish

Tags (e.g., Vegetarian, Gluten-Free, Quick)

Users can mark recipes as favorites for easy access.

2.2 Weekly Meal Planner

Each meal slot can be assigned a recipe.

Users can copy a week’s plan to another week.

Ability to view planned meals in calendar view or list view.

Notifications/reminders for planned meals (optional).

2.3 Automatic Shopping List

Generate a shopping list based on planned recipes.

Merge duplicate ingredients (e.g., 2x “tomatoes” → 4 tomatoes).

Allow users to:

Check/uncheck items while shopping

Manually add items not in recipes

Export list to text, CSV, or PDF

Optional: categorize shopping list by sections (e.g., Vegetables, Dairy, Meat).

2.4 Recipe Search & Filtering

Search recipes by:

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **`mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`** – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. **`mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`** – create this file to describe the logo image that should be generated.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
